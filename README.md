# Welcome!!

Hey! I'm Michael :) I've recently graduated from my undergraduate degree in Advanced Computing and invite you to find out a bit more about myself through the things I've been doing since then.

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring the fields of cognitive science and linguistics to see how I may further pursue study.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Farsi and how to do the splits (my New Years Resolution)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Anything cool or interesting, just get in [contact](#connect-with-me) :)


## Publications

Here are some of the publications I've previously worked on:

### [The sub-band cepstrum as a tool for locating local spectral regions of phonetic sensitivity: A first attempt with multi speaker vowel data.](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/lambropoulos24_interspeech.html)
- Description: Through work done over the summer of 2023-24 at ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, I worked under Dr Shunichi Ishihara in studying novel methods of signal processing using a new approach to exploring sociophonetic study through cepstrum coefficient analysis and representation.


  
### Towards an Implementation of Rhetorical Structure Theory in Discourse Analysis. (Submitted for review to the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA 2024))
- Description: A long paper submission of my honours thesis which was motivated by the question of whether you could assess how "coherent" a discourse was through machine learning methods - specifically graph-based deep-learning. This work drew heavily from theory discussed in Jurafsky and Martin's *Speech and Language Processing*.
